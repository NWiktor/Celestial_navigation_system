def rk4(func, t0, y0, h, *args):
    """ The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method approximates the solution (function) of a first-order ODE.

    Given a y'(t) = f(t, y(t), *args) ODE, and known an initial value of the solution (initial condition) as y(t0)=y0.
    Short explanation: Putting numbers in the ODE gives us the derivative of the solution function at a given place.
    Using this derivative, we can approximate linearly the next value of the solution function. By doing this
    repeteadly, we numerically integrated the ODE, and created the solution function.

    func - ODE function
    t0 - initial time - arbitrary
    y0 - function (solution) value at t0 - initial condition
    h - timestep
    *args - additional constants, or parameters, which is needed for the ODE function
