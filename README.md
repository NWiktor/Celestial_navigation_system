# Celestial navigation system
Hello!

This is a hobby-project, to create a software to navigate inside the solar
system, namely
* Model the movement of the planets and moons / asteroids in the solar system,
thus create a live "starmap".
* Calculate launch trajectories from different planets, and reach orbits around
them.
* Calculate interplanetary trajectories, and achieve orbital insertion.
* Calculate fuel consumption.
* Attitude control of spacecraft.

In the future, it is planned to refactor the python code to C / C++ as an
exercise.

## To-dos
* Launch trajectory calculation in an object-centered, inertial-frame of
reference (e.g. spacecraft launch from Earth)
* Animation for self-checks

## Thanks
